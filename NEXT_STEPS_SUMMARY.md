## ðŸ†˜ If You Get Stuck

- **Videos too complex?** Just record with Zoom/Loom
- **No sales?** Share in Facebook groups

## ðŸŽ¯ The Main Thing

**Focus on getting your FIRST sale!**

Everything else can be improved later. One sale validates everything and gives you momentum.

Your course is 95% ready. The last 5% is just pressing a few buttons and recording yourself talking.

**You're literally hours away from your first $497!**
