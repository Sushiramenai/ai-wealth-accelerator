# ðŸš€ EMERGENCY 2-HOUR LAUNCH PLAN

   - Save as PDF

3. **Quick Start Guide** (15 min)
   - Step 1: Sign up for ChatGPT
   - Step 2: Try these 5 prompts
   - Step 3: Find your first client
   - Add screenshots

### Hour 2: Technical Setup

1. **PayPal** (15 min)
   - Get Client ID
   - Add to index.html
   - Test with $1

2. **Email** (15 min)
   - Set up Gmail auto-reply
   - Use the template provided
   - Test it works

3. **Upload Content** (15 min)
   - Add video links to Module 1
   - Upload PDF to Google Drive

### Post-Launch Promise
Add this to your course portal:
"New content added weekly! This is a living course that grows with you."

This buys you time to add more while keeping customers happy.

### Emergency Support Response
If someone complains:
"Thank you for your patience! We're experiencing high demand. Here's a bonus [give them something extra] while we resolve this. We'll fix this within 24 hours."

Remember: It's better to launch with something real than to delay forever!
